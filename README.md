## About the Course

Computational science has become a third partner, together with theory and experimentation, in advancing scientific knowledge and practice, and an essential tool for product and process development and manufacturing in industry. Big data science adds the 'fourth pillar' to scientific advancements, providing the methods and algorithms to extract knowledge or insights from data. CS205 is a journey into the foundations of Parallel Computing at the intersection of computational and big data sciences. This is an applications course highlighting the use of modern computing platforms in solving computational and data science problems, enabling simulation, modelling and real-time analysis of complex natural and social phenomena at unprecedented scales. The class emphasizes on making effective use of the diverse landscape of programming models, platforms, open-source tools and computing architectures for high performance computing and big data.

## About the Projects

Extreme scale data science at the convergence of big data and massively parallel computing is enabling simulation, modelling and real-time analysis of complex natural and social phenomena at unprecedented scales. The aim of the projects is to gain practical experience into this interplay by applying parallel computation principles in solving a compute and data-intensive problem.

These final projects solve a data-intensive or a compute-intensive problem with parallel processing on the AWS cloud or on Harvard’s supercomputer: Odyssey (or both!). They have identified a compute or and data science problem, analysed its compute scaling requirementd, collected the data, designed and implemented a parallel software, and demonstrated scaled performance of an end-to-end application.
